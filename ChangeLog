	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-14.
	* Removed use of custom function environments in the estimation. Passing
	instead an argument list between functions (resolves various problems for
	non-shared environments e.g. use of snow and certain solvers). 
	* Parallel estimation now done entirely using the parallel package, given a
	user supplied cluster object.
	* ugarchroll and arfimaroll completely re-written and some functionality 
	changed (see help files). as.uGARCHforecast and as.ARFIMAforecast methods 
	removed, and access methods on the rolling objects simplified, as the object 
	returns a much cleaner output. Additionally, a new method called resume will
	allow the resumption of rolling objects which had non-converged windows using
	different solver and control option combinations. All methods on objects
	with non-converged windows will now stop and warn. A new option window.size
	allows to control the amount of data used for the moving window estimation.
	* ugarchspec now warns on misspelled options in the specification. Exact 
	(not partial) matching is done on the options in the variance and mean model
	lists [thanks to Pat Burns].
	* variance.targeting option in GARCH specification now allows either logical 
	or numeric value (in which case that is used instead of the unconditional 
	variance of the conditional mean residuals) [user request].
	* fit.control takes an extra option, 'rec.init' for the type of method used 
	to initialize the GARCH recursion ("all" for all data, integer value >1 for
	using the first n points, or positive numeric value <=1 for exponential
	backcast method)
	* The GARCH bootstrap method (ugarchboot) has been re-written and enhanced
	to allow for sampling from both the raw residuals, kernel fitted residuals
	or SPD (new dependency with spd package) fitted residuals. Returned objects
	are also more simple to manipulate with extractor methods.
	* Fix to GHST distribution density.
	* Fix to arfima simulation initialization requirement (n.start>=MA order).
	* Minor code fixes
	* vignette updated

	* Fix to hybrid solver default trace argument
	* 2 sided Hessian now moved to C++
	* Some enhancements/fixes to date identification utility for recognising
	date formats

	2 regressors used) [thanks to Florian Ziel].

	* Ability to set upper and lower bounds via setbounds<- function on
	a  uGARCHspec object.

2012-09-30  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-12.
	* Added a hybrid strategy optimization method to sequentially try a list of 
	alternative solvers in case of non-convergence.

	to residuals method to return the standardized residuals for both the
	arfima and garch classes.

	* Added the Component GARCH model of Lee and Engle (1999)
	with a complete set of methods.
	* ugarchroll now only allows n.ahead=1 (alternative was too complicated).
	* Change to ugarchboot to allow simulated external regressors input 
	separately from the forecast of the external regressors.
	
2012-06-30  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-10.
	* Fix in ugarchboot (full method) for higher GARCH and ARMA orders.
	* Numerous fixes to methods involving variance targeting.
	* Fix to egarchsim when n.sim<100 and m.sim>100 (c++ code -- brackets in 
	wrong place!)

2012-05-23  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-9.
	* Added autoarfima function to select best arfima model based on information 
	criterion using optionally complete enumeration of the combination space for 
	the max AR and MA orders chosen.
	* Fix to some .C calls to eliminate Null being passed (affected only filter 
	method).
	* Fix avoid error in uncertainty functions for arfima and garch 
	(ugarchdistribution and arfimadistribution) when using spec rather than fit.
	* Bounds for AR and MA increased to [-4,4] for models with orders higher 
	than 1.
	* Fix in ugarchroll to include external.regressors in forecast
