	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-10.
	* Fix in ugarchboot (full method) for higher GARCH and ARMA orders.
	* Numerous fixes to methods involving variance targeting.
	* Fix to egarchsim when n.sim<100 and m.sim>100 (c++ code -- brackets in wrong
	place!)
	* Fix to ugarchroll using multicore, and correct f01density slot.

2012-05-23  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-9.
	* Added autoarfima function to select best arfima model based on information 
	criterion using optionally complete enumeration of the combination space for 
	the max AR and MA orders chosen.
	* Fix to some .C calls to eliminate Null being passed (affected only filter 
	method).
	* Fix avoid error in uncertainty functions for arfima and garch (ugarchdistribution 
	and arfimadistribution) when using spec rather than fit.
	* Bounds for AR and MA increased to [-4,4] for models with orders higher than 1.
	* Fix in ugarchroll to include external.regressors in forecast

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-8.
	* Turned off stationarity check during calculation of numerical derivatives
	to avoid boundary case problems.
	* Addded nloptr solver to estimation toolbox.
	* Added Generalized Hyperbolic Skew Student distribution ("GHST").
	* Added a battery of tests including VaRTest, VaRDurTest, ESTest, GMMTest
	and HLTest.
	* Renamed BerkowitzLR to BerkowitzTest.
	* Updated Vignette with details on changes.
	* Fixed a bug when spec had include.mean = FALSE but fitting routine 
	was still subtracting the mean.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-7.
	* Fix to eGARCH model in the presence of variance.targeting.
	* Fix to ugarchspec when external.regressors in variance equation > 1.
	* Vignette clarifications.
	* Added (experimental) archex argument in mean.model (suggestion of 
	Pooya Nazeran)
	* Added vcov and convergence extractor methods to uGARCHfit object.

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-6.
	* '&' replaced by 'and' in some plots and summary methods for
	better compatibility with tikz (requested by a user).

2011-10-15  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-5.
	* Fix to makevars (for solaris build).
	* Fix to avoid multicore note on windows checks.

2011-10-12  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-4.
	* Added tail.test option to BerkowitzLR test. This is a likelihood ratio 
	test based on censored normal for testing fit of the tail using the 
	probability integral transform (PIT).
	* Added an example to the DACtest function (in documentation).
	* Fixed a bug in rolling forecast when calling ghyp functions with variable length lambda
	(changes to qdensity and scaledist to handle vector inputs of lambda).

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-3.
	* Fix to starting and fixed parameters for AR coefficient.
	* Added a show method for uGARCHroll.
	* Fixed an issue with passing a data.frame object with numerical
	indices as rownames (affected most ugarchroll extractor methods).


2011-09-20  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-2.
	* More minor changes to some show methods and ugarchbench.
	* Changes to optimization limits for external regressors.
	* Bug fix in rolling forecast with arfima (reported by John Kerpel 20-09-2011)

2011-09-05  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0-1.
	* Some minor changes to reduce warnings on CRAN check.
	* packageStartupMessage used for .onLoad
	* Export of GARCHfilter, uGARCHfilter, GARCHroll and uGARCHroll classes (forgot them
	on original release!).
	* Optional use of multicore will still generate warnings (since not available
	for Windows.
	* Vignette pdf is pre-built (Rnw simply links to the pdf).
		
2011-08-30  Alexios Ghalanos <alexios@4dscape.com>
	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 1.0.
	* rugarch represents an almost complete re-write of the univariate GARCH models of the
	rgarch package which is now being split into seperate univariate (rugarch) and multivariate (rmgarch) 
	packages for easier maintenance.
	* Completed Vignette.
	* Numerous corrections, elimination of redundant code, and some new functionality has been added.
	* ARFIMA simulation corrections and multiple checks.
	* rugarch.tests folder now contains an almost comprehensive set of examples and tests which can be
	run via a wrapper function found in the runtests.R file.
	* First upload to CRAN.
